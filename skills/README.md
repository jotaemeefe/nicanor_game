# skills/

Skills are reusable execution patterns. Where rules say what good looks like, and commands say how work starts, skills define how work is carried out well. Each skill is a self-contained, step-by-step procedure with explicit inputs, outputs, quality criteria, and failure modes.

## What skills do

A skill gives an agent a concrete, repeatable process for a specific task. Without a skill, an agent falls back on generic behavior. With a skill loaded:

- the agent follows a defined process rather than improvising
- inputs and outputs are declared, so handoffs are clean
- quality criteria are explicit, so done means done
- common failure modes are documented, so the agent avoids known pitfalls

Skills are invoked by agents when executing commands. They are not invoked directly.

Each `SKILL.md` follows a shared section layout (Purpose, Use When, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Quality Bar, Common Failure Modes, Related Agents, Related Commands, Notes). Skills may additionally include an optional `## Related Skills` section (between Related Commands and Notes) listing complementary skills; entries are validated against the skill set by `npm run validate:structure`.

## Skill domains

Skills are organized into nine domain folders. Each skill lives in its own subfolder with a `SKILL.md` file.

## Skill file format

Each skill uses a standard YAML frontmatter block followed by a ten-section body:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: One-line purpose statement
origin: everything-game-dev-code
category: domain-name
---
```

The body sections are: **Purpose**, **Use When**, **Inputs**, **Process**, **Outputs**, **Quality Bar**, **Common Failure Modes**, **Related Agents**, **Related Commands**, **Notes**.

## Relationship to other folders

- **agents/** — agents execute skills; skills are the work unit, agents are the identity
- **commands/** — commands trigger agents which invoke the relevant skill for the task
- **rules/** — skills reference the rules layer for engine-specific implementation detail; they do not duplicate it
- **contexts/** — the active context signals which skill domains are highest priority for the current phase
- **docs/orchestration/agent-skill-matrix.md** — authoritative mapping of agents to their primary and secondary skills
