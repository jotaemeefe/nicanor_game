**Unity** · **Unreal Engine** · **Godot** · **HTML/JS** — 2D and 3D, strict engine isolation, shared standards.

---

Not just a prompt collection — a structured operating system for game projects that combines:
- **Rules** for policy and standards
- **Agents** for role specialization
- **Commands** for repeatable entry points
- **Skills** for reusable execution patterns
- **Contexts** for phase-specific behavior
- **Hooks** for workflow automation
- **Harness adapters** for Claude, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, and Kiro (see [docs/harness-support.md](docs/harness-support.md) for what each one supports)

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MRCalderon3D/everything-game-dev-code.git
cd everything-game-dev-code
npm run setup:hooks
```

`npm run setup:hooks` wires the repo's pre-commit checks (structure sync + validation) so committed artifacts never drift; it needs Node.js 18+ and takes one second. Run `npm run doctor` at any time to diagnose your installation (environment, hooks, active engine profile, generated-artifact drift) with remediation hints.

Open the folder in your AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, or Kiro). The scaffold is loaded from the assistant's adapter plus the shared `AGENTS.md`, `rules/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, and `skills/` layers.

Then type commands in the chat:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/plan` | Outline your project before coding |
| `/gdd` | Generate a Game Design Document |
| `/tdd` | Apply test-driven development to the current task |
| `/scene-bootstrap` | Scaffold a new scene |
| `/unity-setup` | Bootstrap a Unity project with conventions |
| `/unity-build-fix` | Diagnose and fix Unity build errors |
| `/godot-setup` | Bootstrap a Godot project |
| `/unreal-setup` | Bootstrap an Unreal project |
| `/web-setup` | Bootstrap a web (HTML5) project, 2D canvas or 3D WebGL |
| `/generate-assets` | Generate real assets — images, skyboxes, 3D models, SFX, music, voice, video — from text prompts |
| `/full-game` | Orchestrate an entire game from scratch (experimental) |

You don't have to follow a specific order. Pick whatever command fits your current need — start a new project, generate a GDD for an existing one, run a QA review, or fix a build error.

### Step-by-step guide

The `guides/Dash & Collect/` folder contains a full tutorial that walks through building a game using the scaffold's commands, agents, skills, and contexts across all project phases.

### Example projects

The `samples/` folder contains thirteen complete HTML games built with the `/full-game` command in a single pass each (PirateInvaders, Tetris2DMutation, LosRenacidos, pacmanAI, harness-comparison variants, PrismDefense3D — the first 3D sample, built on Three.js against the web 3D rules, plus its CC0-textured Visuals variant and its AssetsGen variant where every model, texture, skybox, sound, and the intro cinematic were generated through the `/generate-assets` layer, and NebulaLance — a 2.5D R-Type-style shoot-'em-up whose ship, enemies, boss, nebula, audio, and image-to-video menu cinematic are all AI-generated), plus a writeup comparing how different AI harnesses performed on the same brief. For real projects, we recommend going step by step.

## Goals
- Keep shared game-development standards engine-neutral.
- Let Unity, Unreal, Godot, and the web layer each extend the base cleanly without contaminating one another.
- Support real production work across design, engineering, content, QA, release, and live ops.
- Turn repeated solutions into reusable skills and structured workflows.
- Make the repository portable across multiple coding assistants and harnesses.

## Repository Model
This scaffold is organized in layers:

- `rules/` — what good looks like
- `agents/` — who does the work
- `commands/` — how work starts
- `skills/` — how work is executed well
- `contexts/` — how priorities shift by phase
- `hooks/` — how workflow safeguards are enforced
- `manifests/` — how subsets are installed by profile, plus the engine layer registry (`engines.json`) and the generative asset provider registry (`asset-providers.json`)
- `schemas/` — JSON validation for manifests, hooks, and plugins
- `scripts/` — generators, validators, and diagnostics (`new:engine`, `doctor`, `sync:*`)
- `docs/templates/` — structured templates for GDD, TDD, QA plans, and other deliverables
- `docs/orchestration/` — agent routing, role handoffs, and workflow sequences
- `tests/` — how the scaffold verifies itself
- harness adapters — how different AI clients consume the same source of truth

## Engine Isolation Policy
The repository is intentionally split into:
- `rules/common/`
- `rules/unity/`
- `rules/unreal/`
- `rules/godot/`
- `rules/web/`

And equivalent skill / command / review layers where needed.

Shared documents should describe **intent**, **ownership**, and **quality bars**. Engine-specific files should describe **implementation conventions** inside that engine only.

## AI Asset Generation (optional)
The scaffold ships an **optional** engine-neutral asset generation layer. It is an
upgrade, not a dependency: the default asset workflow is unchanged, and AI generation
only activates when a provider API key is present in the environment.

**Without a key (default).** Use the scaffold's built-in tooling exactly as always:
the engine placeholder commands (`/unity-placeholders`, `/godot-placeholders`,
`/web-placeholders`) and the procedural / Canvas / WebAudio pipelines. A game built
entirely on placeholders is a complete, valid result — nothing about the workflow
requires an API.

**With a key (`FAL_KEY` for the default fal.ai provider).** `/generate-assets` becomes
available to upgrade placeholders to real content from text prompts:

1. Generate placeholders first so every asset has a stable name and path.
2. Run `/generate-assets` to produce images and textures, equirectangular skyboxes, 3D models (GLB/OBJ), sound effects, music, voice lines, and intro/cinematic video — dropped onto those same names and paths (zero code changes).
3. Import through the active engine layer and review with the matching pass command (`/art-2d-pass`, `/art-3d-pass`, `/audio-pass`).

**Resolution order, quality, and cost.** For images and skyboxes the scaffold prefers a
free harness-native generator (e.g. Codex `$imagegen`) when the running harness has one,
then the paid API, then placeholders; 3D/audio/video only have the API or placeholder
paths. Quality vs price is the user's dial: every capability has `budget` / `balanced` /
`premium` tiers (`--quality`, default `balanced`) — a full asset pass runs roughly
$2-3 / $5-7 / $10+ respectively. Because the API costs money, generation also asks before
spending: every run prints a cost estimate, and `scripts/generate-assets.js` refuses runs
at or above a configurable threshold (`confirmOverUsd`) without explicit confirmation.
Autonomous flows like `/full-game` keep placeholders as the default and ask once — tier
and spend — before generating.

Capability-to-model routing lives in [manifests/asset-providers.json](manifests/asset-providers.json) (default provider: fal.ai — one pay-per-use key covers every modality). `scripts/generate-assets.js` performs the generation and writes a `.provenance.json` sidecar (provider, model, prompt, seed, request id) per run; assets without provenance are treated as unlicensed content. The key is read only from the `FAL_KEY` environment variable and is never committed (`.env` files are gitignored). Governance rules — the optional-capability, resolution-order, and cost-confirmation policy — live in [rules/common/asset-pipeline.md](rules/common/asset-pipeline.md). For a worked end-to-end example see the `samples/PrismDefense3DAssetsGen` variant.

## Intended Use Cases
- New game project setup
- Multi-engine studio workflows
- Internal AI workflow standardization
- GDD and technical design maintenance
- QA and release readiness reviews
- Plugin / content / tooling governance
- Cross-discipline planning and orchestration

## Supported Harnesses
- Claude Code
- Codex
- Cursor
- OpenCode
- Kiro

Each harness adapter points back to the same shared scaffold rather than becoming a second source of truth.

### MCP servers
The scaffold curates a set of MCP servers (browser playtesting, AI asset generation, Blender/DCC control, and more) in [mcp-configs/mcp-servers.json](mcp-configs/mcp-servers.json), with ready-to-use, harness-native configs generated into [mcp-configs/generated/](mcp-configs/generated/). MCP is vendor-neutral, so they work with any MCP-capable client. See [docs/mcp-setup.md](docs/mcp-setup.md) for per-harness install and a Blender end-to-end walkthrough.

### Codex usage
Codex should start from `AGENTS.md` and `.codex/README.md`. Slash-style commands such as `/plan`, `/gdd`, and `/unity-review` map to `commands/<name>.md`; if the Codex client does not execute slash commands natively, type the command name in chat and ask Codex to run the matching scaffold command.
For raster-first asset work in Codex, use `$imagegen` alongside the shared art pipeline skills. Good fits include concept sheets, sprite source art, UI mockups, marketing key art, painted backgrounds, and bitmap edits; keep vector/code-native asset work in the normal repo workflows. If a generated image becomes a real project asset, move the selected file from `$CODEX_HOME/generated_images/...` into the workspace and keep the scaffold's naming and folder conventions.

## Current Status
The scaffold is intentionally modular. Different blocks may be added or replaced over time, but the repository should always preserve:
- flat agent and command structures
- layered rules
- grouped skills
- engine isolation
- harness portability

## Principles
- Design before implementation
- Explicit ownership over implicit assumptions
- Testability over cleverness
- Documentation that supports execution
- Measured performance and release readiness
- Accessibility, QA, and compliance as first-class requirements
